    <h>Group Counselling</h><br>
   <p>Counseling definition</p>
    <p>The provision of professional assistance and guidance in resolving personal or psychological problems.<br>
    The process of counselling is where individuals, couples or family members meet with a professional counselor to<br>
      confidentially discuss problems in their lives.</p>
    <ol>
      <h>Other definitions of counselling</h>
      <li>Counsellor:A counsellor is a person or someone who provides counselling</li>
      <li>Counselee:A counselee is a person who recieves counselling from a counsellor</li>
    </ol>
    <h>Group Counselling</h>
    <p>Group counseling is a form of psychotherapy in which two to 15 participants meet face-to-face to work through their <br>
      problems and concerns under the guidance of one or two mental health professionals. Such groups can provide support and<br>
      perspective—and often suggestions and models for change—to individuals struggling on their own. Group counseling can be helpful<br>
      both as a sole form of therapy and when used as a supplement to individual therapy. Most groups meet regularly, once or twice weekly,<br>
      in sessions that last from one to two hours.</p><br>
    <p>Some groups are dedicated to a specific problem, such as depression, anger management, or substance abuse, while others more broadly seek <br>
      to expand participants’ social skills. Some groups have open sessions, which anyone can attend at any time. Others are closed; they have a fixed<br>
      set of participants, and new members are accepted only when an individual concludes a course of therapy or leaves the group.</p>
    <h>Benefits of Group Counselling</h><br>
    <ol>
      <li>Emotional support</li><br>
      <p>Initial hesitation to discuss personal problems and deep concerns with a room full of strangers is understandable, but participants typically find<br>
        the group experience extremely rewarding. Having problems is isolating, and individuals often feel that they are the only person struggling; participating <br>
        in a group relieves the burden of isolation and, often, shame and frees up energy.</p><br>
      <li>Motivation and hope</li><br>
      <p>Group members can act as a sounding board and give helpful advice based on firsthand knowledge of the problem and what does and doesn’t work. In group counseling,<br>
        participants make a commitment not only to themselves but to everyone in the group. They can hold each other accountable for making real progress on the changes they<br>
        wish to see in their lives. Plus, witnessing group members making therapeutic progress can instill hope that change is possible.</p><br>
      <li>Social skills</li><br>
      <p>Group counseling offers a supportive environment for developing and practicing social skills. The group leader(s) can observe firsthand any unhelpful habits that may<br>
        be causing problems in the participants’ real-life relationships and offer practical, immediate suggestions. Through group counseling exercises, participants can experiment<br>
        with new behaviors and different ways of communicating.</p>
