 <h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
<p>In Zambia, adolescents and young people currently constitute more than half of the total population. They<br>
face many health and development problems (substance use, early marriages and alcohol consumption,
Sexually Transmitted Infections (STI), Human Immune-Deficiency Virus (HIV) and Acquired ImmunoDeficiency 
  Syndrome (AIDS), early pregnancies, unwanted pregnancies, nutritional deficiencies, etc)
which today affect their lives and the socio-economic development of the country (Adolescent Health -
ADH Situation Analysis, 2009). Zambia recognizes the importance and significant impact that adolescents
and young people have on the overall health status of the country, including the attainment of the national
health objectives and Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).</p>
<p>In view of the foregoing, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has identified the need to strengthen Adolescent
Friendly Health Services (ADFHS), by developing and implementing national Standards of Care, aimed at
providing comprehensive quality services and coordinated response to adolescents and young peopleâ€™s
needs in the country. This document presents the six standards of care for adolescents and young
people in Zambia. It seeks to provide a guide for strengthening the coordination and delivery of quality
adolescent friendly health services, and ensuring appropriate monitoring and evaluation (M&E).</p> <p>The
national standards of care have been developed and will be implemented within the framework of the
ADH Strategic Plan 2011 to 2015 and the National Health Strategic Plan 2011 to 2015 (NHSP 2011-15),
which presents the overall strategic framework for health sector governance and development in Zambia.
The document has been developed through broad consultations and involvement of young people and
the key stakeholders, including the other sectors, religious groups, civil society and Cooperating Partners </p>
